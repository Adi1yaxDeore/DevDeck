# My React Website

This is a simple React website built with TypeScript. Below are the instructions on how to set up, run, and build the application.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

To run the application in development mode, use the following command:

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. The application will automatically reload if you make changes to the source files.
